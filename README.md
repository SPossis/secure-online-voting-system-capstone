This repository documents a team-based capstone project focused on designing a secure and scalable online voting system. The project emphasizes security architecture, identity management, auditability, and system resilience.

## Project Objectives
- Protect voter anonymity and ballot integrity
- Implement strong identity verification and multi-factor authentication
- Ensure auditability, logging, and regulatory readiness
- Design for accessibility and scalability

## Security Concepts Applied
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- MFA (FIDO2, OTP, biometrics)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Audit logging and SIEM monitoring concepts
- Zero Trust security principles

## My Contributions
- Security architecture documentation
- Identity, authentication, and authorization design
- Audit logging and compliance considerations
- Risk and threat analysis support

## Disclaimer
This project is a **conceptual and academic design**. No production system was implemented.
